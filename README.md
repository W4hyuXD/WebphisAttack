# Web Phising Attackers

This tool functions to attack phishing websites/scamming websites that are typically created to deceive someone by luring victims with promises of diamonds or rare in-game items. The tool's working method is quite simple, which is by sending fake login data or information to the phishing website with the aim of disrupting it.
